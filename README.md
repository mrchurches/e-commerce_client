## Description

As a team, we created a video game e-commerce where games are acquired through activation licenses. The platform offers functionalities for "guest", "user", and "administrator", along with a mobile application. 

- **Guest**: Can review the video game catalog, see game details, add games to the shopping cart, and create an account with email or Google authentication. 
- **User**: Can add/remove a video game from favorites, buy video games, check their purchases, comment on purchased video games, edit comments, rate video games, modify profile information (name, last name, username, password, profile picture), and receive email notifications of their activity.
- **Administrator**: Can ban users, view purchase statistics, assign user privileges, view available games, modify game information, create new games, disable games, and view the catalog.
